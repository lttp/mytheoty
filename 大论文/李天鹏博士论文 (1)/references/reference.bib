abstract = {{In many practical applications of clustering, the objects to be clustered evolve over time, and a clustering result is desired at each time step. In such applications, evolutionary clustering typically outperforms traditional static clustering by producing clustering results that reflect long-term trends while being robust to short-term variations. Several evolutionary clustering algorithms have recently been proposed, often by adding a temporal smoothness penalty to the cost function of a static clustering method. In this paper, we introduce a different approach to evolutionary clustering by accurately tracking the time-varying proximities between objects followed by static clustering. We present an evolutionary clustering framework that adaptively estimates the optimal smoothing parameter using shrinkage estimation, a statistical approach that improves a naïve estimate using additional information. The proposed framework can be used to extend a variety of static clustering algorithms, including hierarchical, k-means, and spectral clustering, into evolutionary clustering algorithms. Experiments on synthetic and real data sets indicate that the proposed framework outperforms static clustering and existing evolutionary clustering algorithms in many scenarios.}},

Nevertheless, most of the approaches are constrained to static scenarios. Some solutions adapted to dynamic social networks present performance limitations, and others do not fit well in such contexts. This situation aggravates when considering the demand to analyze constantly growing networks as real-world social networks. This work presents the Actor–Critic for Community Detection (AC2CD) architecture for community detection in dynamic social networks. The architecture based on the deep reinforcement learning strategy deals with changing aspects of large networks using a local optimization of the modularity density function. The experiments using real-world dynamic network datasets present better results than state-of-art solutions, indicating that AC2CD copes well with dynamic real-world social networks.}

abstract = {{Existing network embedding algorithms based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) improve the robustness of node embeddings by selecting high-quality negative samples with the generator to play against the discriminator. Since most of the negative samples can be easily discriminated from positive samples in graphs, their poor competitiveness weakens the function of the generator. Inspired by the sales skills in the market, in this article, we present tripartite adversarial training for network embeddings (TriATNE), a novel adversarial learning framework for learning stable and robust node embeddings. TriATNE consists of three players: 1) producer; 2) seller; and 3) customer. The producer strives to learn the representation of each sample (node pair), making it easy for the customer to differentiate between the positive and the negative, while the seller tries to confuse the customer by selecting realistic-looking samples. The customer, a biased evaluation metric, provides feedback for training the producer and the seller. To further enhance the robustness of node embedding, we model the customer as a two-layer neural network, where each unit in the hidden layer can be regarded as a customer with different preferences. TriATNE also plays against the producer by adjusting the weight of each customer. We test the performance of TriATNE on two common tasks: classification as well as link prediction. The experimental results on various publicly available datasets show that TriATNE can exploit the network structure well.}},

abstract = {{In this article, we first propose a graph neural network encoding method for the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to handle the community detection problem in complex attribute networks. In the graph neural network encoding method, each edge in an attribute network is associated with a continuous variable. Through nonlinear transformation, a continuous valued vector (i.e., a concatenation of the continuous variables associated with the edges) is transferred to a discrete valued community grouping solution. Further, two objective functions for the single-attribute and multiattribute network are proposed to evaluate the attribute homogeneity of the nodes in communities, respectively. Based on the new encoding method and the two objectives, a MOEA based upon NSGA-II, called continuous encoding MOEA, is developed for the transformed community detection problem with continuous decision variables. Experimental results on single-attribute and multiattribute networks with different types show that the developed algorithm performs significantly better than some well-known evolutionary- and nonevolutionary-based algorithms. The fitness landscape analysis verifies that the transformed community detection problems have smoother landscapes than those of the original problems, which justifies the effectiveness of the proposed graph neural network encoding method.}},

In this paper, we suggest a network reduction-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for community detection in large-scale networks, where the size of the networks is recursively reduced as the evolution proceeds. In each reduction of the network, the local communities found by the elite individuals in the population are identified as nodes of the reduced network for further evolution, thereby considerably reducing the search space. A local community repairing strategy is also suggested to correct the misidentified nodes after each network reduction during the evolution. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over several state-of-the-art community detection algorithms for large-scale networks, in terms of both computational efficiency and detection performance.}},

abstract = {{Designing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) for community detection in complex networks has attracted much attention of researchers recently. However, most of the existing methods focus on addressing the task of nonoverlapping community detection, where each node must belong to one and only one community. In fact, communities are often overlapped with each other in many real-world networks, thus it is necessary to design overlapping community detection algorithms. To this end, this paper proposes a mixed representation-based MOEA (MR-MOEA) for overlapping community detection. In MR-MOEA, a mixed individual representation scheme is proposed to fast encode and decode the overlapping divisions of complex networks. Specifically, this mixed representation consists of two parts: one represents all potential overlapping nodes and the other delegates all nonoverlapping nodes. These two parts evolve together to detect the overlapping communities of networks based on different updating strategies suggested in MR-MOEA. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm MR-MOEA on ten real-world complex networks and the experimental results demonstrate that MR-MOEA is superior over six representative algorithms for overlapping community detection.}},

Capturing such evolution is key to predicting the properties of unseen networks. To understand how the network dynamics affect the prediction performance, we propose an embedding approach which learns the structure of evolution in dynamic graphs and can predict unseen links with higher precision. Our model, dyngraph2vec, learns the temporal transitions in the network using a deep architecture composed of dense and recurrent layers. We motivate the need for capturing dynamics for the prediction on a toy dataset created using stochastic block models. We then demonstrate the efficacy of dyngraph2vec over existing state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets. We observe that learning dynamics can improve the quality of embedding and yield better performance in link prediction.}},

abstract = {{Spectral algorithms are classic approaches to clustering and community detection in networks. However, for sparse networks the standard versions of these algorithms are suboptimal, in some cases completely failing to detect communities even when other algorithms such as belief propagation can do so. Here, we present a class of spectral algorithms based on a nonbacktracking walk on the directed edges of the graph. The spectrum of this operator is much better-behaved than that of the adjacency matrix or other commonly used matrices, maintaining a strong separation between the bulk eigenvalues and the eigenvalues relevant to community structure even in the sparse case. We show that our algorithm is optimal for graphs generated by the stochastic block model, detecting communities all of the way down to the theoretical limit. We also show the spectrum of the nonbacktracking operator for some real-world networks, illustrating its advantages over traditional spectral clustering.}},

doi = {10.1145/2939672.2939753}, 
abstract = {{Network embedding is an important method to learn low-dimensional representations of vertexes in networks, aiming to capture and preserve the network structure. Almost all the existing network embedding methods adopt shallow models. However, since the underlying network structure is complex, shallow models cannot capture the highly non-linear network structure, resulting in sub-optimal network representations. Therefore, how to find a method that is able to effectively capture the highly non-linear network structure and preserve the global and local structure is an open yet important problem. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a Structural Deep Network Embedding method, namely SDNE. More specifically, we first propose a semi-supervised deep model, which has multiple layers of non-linear functions, thereby being able to capture the highly non-linear network structure. Then we propose to exploit the first-order and second-order proximity jointly to preserve the network structure. The second-order proximity is used by the unsupervised component to capture the global network structure. While the first-order proximity is used as the supervised information in the supervised component to preserve the local network structure. By jointly optimizing them in the semi-supervised deep model, our method can preserve both the local and global network structure and is robust to sparse networks. Empirically, we conduct the experiments on five real-world networks, including a language network, a citation network and three social networks. The results show that compared to the baselines, our method can reconstruct the original network significantly better and achieves substantial gains in three applications, i.e. multi-label classification, link prediction and visualization.}},

abstract = {{We discover communities from social network data and analyze the community evolution. These communities are inherent characteristics of human interaction in online social networks, as well as paper citation networks. Also, communities may evolve over time, due to changes to individuals' roles and social status in the network as well as changes to individuals' research interests. We present an innovative algorithm that deviates from the traditional two-step approach to analyze community evolutions. In the traditional approach, communities are first detected for each time slice, and then compared to determine correspondences. We argue that this approach is inappropriate in applications with noisy data. In this paper, we propose FacetNet for analyzing communities and their evolutions through a robust unified process. This novel framework will discover communities and capture their evolution with temporal smoothness given by historic community structures. Our approach relies on formulating the problem in terms of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, where the community structure is estimated both by the observed networked data and by the prior distribution given by historic community structures. Then we develop an iterative algorithm, with proven low time complexity, which is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution. We perform extensive experimental studies, on both synthetic datasets and real datasets, to demonstrate that our method discovers meaningful communities and provides additional insights not directly obtainable from traditional methods.}},

abstract = {{Network science is an interdisciplinary endeavor, with methods and applications drawn from across the natural, social, and information sciences. A prominent problem in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly connected groups of nodes known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of network quality functions that allowed us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in other slices. This framework allows studies of community structure in a general setting encompassing networks that evolve over time, have multiple types of links (multiplexity), and have multiple scales.}},
